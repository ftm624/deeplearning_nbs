# Deep Learning Notebooks
> An exploration of deep learning from the ground up. 

This is a library of jupyter notebooks of fundamental deep learning topics. This documentation is not meant to build a functional library for deep learning. Instead it is an attempt at "literate programming" (Knuth, 1983). 

## Fastai Notebooks
These notebooks are loosely based on the Fastai course <a href="https://course.fast.ai/part2"> Part 2: Deep Learning from the Foundations </a>. They follow the general order of that course and expand upon cencepts and code I found to be particularly interesting.
